# FootballStakes
 The project will have two types of games: regular games and tournament. For this types of games user can place the 
 stakes, he can choose as much games as want, only one constraint will be about putting two stakes for one command simultaniously. 
 There is some difference between regular games and tournament. 
 In regular games commands can play with each other more than one 
 time. Stake could be placed on: win, lose, draw. There are a lot of commands can be placed in this type of game. 
 Tournament has this types of games: small(8 commands), medium(16 commands) and large(32 commands)). Large tournament has stages:
 1/16; 1/8; 1/4; 1/2; and 1 as a final stage. Command that wins got a cup. 
 Stakes can be placed on: win or lose. In this type of game command which lose on 1/8 stage cannot be in 1/4 stage and so on. 
 Once losed command stop playing in tournament. User can place the stake at the same command, but in the different stages. 
 Tournament commands is a national teams with flags of their country. Coefficients in regular games lower than in tournament. 
 They will be setted after game is created regardless from type of game. System has money balance with the statistics where 
 money is coming from. 
 User has it's own money. User will be notified after the game is finished on which he had placed the stake. And the result 
 will be displayed somewhere. User will have statistics about active, won and lose stakes two types of game with detailed 
 information about game. All actions is operating by administrator of this application, he managed about every game, coefficients 
 of the commands and so on. Also administrator can see any information about user and can edit it.
